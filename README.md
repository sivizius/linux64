=======
some useful libraries for amd64 linux.

this libraries are supposed to be included as source.
just include `main.fasm` at the top of your code, then you can use
* `xcode 'library'` to include code/library.fasm
* `xvars 'library'` to include data/library.fdat
* `xresv 'library'` to include resv/library.fres
* `xstat 'library'` to include stat/library.finc
* `xtext 'library'` to include text/library.ftxt

usage and key files
-------------------
* *edit.sh* - edit repository with system-editor (nano, vim, etc)
* *conf.sh* - perhaps useful sometime later
